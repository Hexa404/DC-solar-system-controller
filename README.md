specially for uav purpose. made as light as possible.

This project is a long term and open project, anyone can contribute. I'll make it private if i can get some money to realize it
The idea was making automatic cut off curent for balancing votltage of batteries that attached on uav
I'm not using discharger because its more simpler for me and I'm not going to waste any energy
schematic and code are uploaded soon and keep update until i make it private
